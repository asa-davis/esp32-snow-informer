# esp32-snow-informer

This was my first ever esp32 project. It alternates every two seconds or so between displaying the current snow depth and reported fresh snow at winter park. Every hour, the data is fetched via the ski-resort-forecast api from rapidapi.com. I salvaged a seven segment display from an alarm clock, and after some head-scratching managed to write a driver for it to display the data.
